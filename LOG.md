  My Square and Squares objects feel wrong. Right now, Square objects are creating Chess positions from coordinates. This relationship feels wrong. It feels like the decision of a group of coordinates and group of positions should be determined inside a grouping class, not in the individual Square class.

  Do I need a factory in Board or Squares that creates the correct Square objects for use in Chess?
